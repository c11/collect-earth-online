       - sampleIds: they have to be numbers but the array can be an array of strings or numbers
       - the constructor of Collect Forms was not supposed to be called multiple times... you should reload/change the content of the "container" and then call the constructor again
   15. Cleanup merged database on ceo2:
       - Remove plot-data files for non-existent projects
       - Remove dash files for non-existent geodash dashboards

  - Add the new features (e.g., pro-active sampling) to our embedded database.
  - Change style of imagery on institution page based on public:true/false attribute
  - Prevent imagery deletion if any created or published projects use it as their basemap (but not closed or archived projects)
  - Remove deploy/clientkeystore file from version control and add config settings to mail-config.json and web.xml to include your own HTTPS certificate
  - Give CEO's Tomcat process more memory
  - Ask Stefano about the C:\Users\<username>\OpenForis\Collect\data directory
  - Alfonso shared this GEE grid generation script: https://code.earthengine.google.com/8809a49aba2386b651eafa25f97f39e4
  - Add Google Earth Engine Assets Support as a layer
  - Export of the data from collect directly from project Dashboard, doing it the same as collect--CSV or ZIP; he can get code from stefano
  - AOI of collection as a shapefile, name of country, district, or region--they already have a script in GEE--could Gary interface to that script; or maybe just a button with a tutorial as workaround
  - Work on QA/QC--compare operators against the plots--this is a big task/separate module
  - Check Karis' manual to make sure the DigitalGlobeWMSImagery CONNECTIDs are not present
  - Rebuild and deploy docker image
  - Review Githika's new spreadsheet and give her a new set of tasks
  - Move the CEO data directory to ~/.ceodb
  - Add logging with timestamps

Then include this info in the spreadsheet download as well? It would be pretty cool to also have the confusion/error matrices calculated in mapcha (with the ability to insert new columns for new prediction results since model building is an iterative process).
