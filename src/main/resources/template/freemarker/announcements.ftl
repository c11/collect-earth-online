        DigitalGlobe has recently merged with Maxar Technologies and
        has deprecated its Maps API. As a result, the public
        DigitalGlobeRecentImagery and
        DigitalGlobeRecentImagery+Streets layers are currently
        disabled until we are able to setup a new purchasing agreement
        for their replacement product. Our apologies for the
        inconvenience.
